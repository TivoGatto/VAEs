# VAEs

In this repository I will collect the implementation of some kind of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) models I will use for my thesis. I will include some .py for the score evaluating the quality of these Networks and some .png showing the results. \newline
Here in the README.md I will note some observation I need to remember for each Net.
