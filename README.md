# VAEs

In this repository I will collect the implementation of some kind of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) models I will use for my thesis. I will include some .py for the score evaluating the quality of these Networks and some .png showing the results. \newline
Here in the README.md I will note some observation I need to remember for each Net.

# List of Models compared

A list of VAE models I will compare:

Classic VAEs:
- Naive VAE
- Beta-VAE
- InfoVAE
- AAE (Adversarial Autoencoder)
- VAE-GAN
- MMD-VAE

Autoregressive VAE:
- DRAW
- IAF

## Naive VAE

Phase-transition in changing latent_dim for MNIST.

## Beta-VAE
